# ODIN LIBRARY

This project is part of The Odin Project’s **JavaScript Course**. It’s a simple web application that allows users to manage a personal library of books, designed to apply everything I’ve learned from JavaScript, DOM manipulation, event handling, objects, and object constructors lessons.

---

### This project includes:

- A main page that displays all books in the library
- Functionality to **add new books** with title, author, pages, and status
- Ability to **change a book’s status** (“to-read”, “reading”, “read”) using a dropdown
- Ability to **remove books** from the library
- Each book is assigned a **unique ID** using `crypto.randomUUID()`
- Styling and dynamic updates using pure JavaScript and CSS
- Dummy books with covers fetched from Open Library and a custom placeholder cover image

---

### Through this project, I practiced and demonstrated:

- Creating and using **JavaScript constructor functions** for objects
- Manipulating the **DOM dynamically** to display and update books
- Using **event delegation** for handling clicks on dynamically created elements
- Storing book data in an **array and linking it to DOM elements**
- Managing form submissions and user input
- Applying CSS classes and custom properties for **visual feedback and styling**
